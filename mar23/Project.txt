        - <h1> (ADD an ID)
        - <p> w/ lorem ipsum text (ADD an ID)
        - two <a> tags (use the text inside the paragraph && ADD and ID to both)
    - Style elements to your liking
*/

/*
In your JS file:
    - Create 10 variables targeting each of the ID'd elements
    - Create 5 "click" eventListeners. 1 for each of the buttons && 1 for each of the <a> tags
    - Write 5 functions:
        - 1 that automatically runs on page load; Change <body> background color
        - 1 that toggles the navigation from horizontal orientation to vertical
        - 1 that prompts the user for their first name and adds that name to the text of the <h1>
        - 1 that doubles the users name font-size and changes the color
        - 2 that change the text color of the clicked <a> tag
